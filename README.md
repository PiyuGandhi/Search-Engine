# Search Engine

### A very simple web search engine in python.
Implemented a method index(urls), which – given a list of input URLs – 
–  downloads each web page 
–  strips tags in the resultingHTML
–  normalizes the text data (e.g., using string.lower() and the module stemming.porter2) 
–  computes and stores a sparse bag-of-words representation of each page (e.g., using python dictionaries)
